            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-blue">Carpet Revival</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">Daily life is tough on carpets. Dirt, dust, allergens, and mystery spots get ground in deep. Our Carpet Revival isn't a quick once-over. We use professional hot water extraction to flush out years of built-up grime from the base of the fibres, restoring the pile and leaving your floors genuinely clean and healthy.</p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-blue">Upholstery & Lounge Cleaning</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">Your couch is the centre of your home, and it cops a lot. Spills, pets, kids, movie nights—it all adds up. We safely clean fabric and leather upholstery, identifying the material first to use the right method. We lift out body oils, food stains, and odours, reviving the look and feel of your furniture.</p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-blue">Stain & Spot Treatment</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">That red wine spill? The coffee mishap? The kids' art project? We're the guys to call. We use a range of professional treatments to target specific types of stains. We'll be straight with you—some stains are permanent. But if it can be budged, we have the best chance of getting it done without damaging your carpet.</p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-blue">Pet Odour Treatment</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">We love them, but pets leave their mark. A standard clean won't shift urine odour because the source is deep in the underlay. Our treatment targets the problem at its core. We use specialized enzyme cleaners to break down and neutralize the uric salts that cause the lingering smell. It's a science, and we take it seriously.</p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-blue">Rug Rescue</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">Don't let a dirty rug bring down the look of a room. We treat area rugs with the specific care they need, whether they're tough synthetics or delicate wool. We'll get the ground-in dirt out and bring their colours back to life, right there in your home.</p>
