            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Thanks for trusting us to bring your place back to life. This isn't a scary legal contract—it's just us being upfront about how we work, what we need from you, and what you can expect from the job.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">1. The Job We'll Do</h3>
                    <p>We agree to perform the carpet and/or upholstery cleaning services we quoted you for. We’ll use our professional equipment, the right chemicals for the job, and our best skills to get the best possible result. Our goal is a spotless revival, every time.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">2. What We Need From You</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-2">
                        <li><strong>Access:</strong> A clear path for us to bring our gear in and out.</li>
                        <li><strong>Space:</strong> Please move any small furniture, breakables, toys, and personal items from the areas we'll be cleaning. We can help with larger items like sofas and tables, but we can't move heavy or delicate things like pianos, entertainment units, or antique furniture.</li>
                        <li><strong>Power & Water:</strong> Access to a standard power outlet and a tap (preferably an outdoor one).</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> For their safety, please keep kids and pets in another part of the house or secured away from the work area and our equipment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">3. The Price</h3>
                    <p>The price is what we agreed on in your quote. If we get here and see something that needs a different approach or extra work (like a major stain you forgot to mention), we'll stop and talk to you about it first. No surprise charges, ever.</p>
                </div>
                 <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">4. Paying the Bill</h3>
                    <p>For residential jobs, payment is due on the day, as soon as the job is done. We accept cash, debit, or credit card on the spot. We’ll give you a receipt right then and there.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">5. The Reality of Stains & Damage</h3>
                    <p class="mb-2">We're good, but we're not magicians.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-2">
                        <li><strong>No Guarantee:</strong> We'll do everything we can, but we can't guarantee 100% removal of all stains. Some things—like bleach spots, old dye stains, or pet urine that’s been there for ages—can be permanent. We'll be honest with you about what to expect before we start.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-existing Conditions:</strong> Sometimes, cleaning can reveal existing damage that was hidden by dirt, like worn-out fibres, sun fading, or delamination (where the carpet backing separates). We are not responsible for pre-existing issues that become visible after a proper clean.</li>
                        <li><strong>DIY Spotters:</strong> If you've used a supermarket spot cleaner or tried a home remedy, please let us know. These chemicals can react with our professional products and affect the final result.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">6. A Heads-Up on Certain Fibres</h3>
                    <p>Every carpet is different. Natural fibres like wool and cotton need special care. We are trained to clean them safely, but there's always a small risk of things like minor shrinkage or colour variation. We manage this by using wool-safe, pH-neutral products and proper techniques.</p>

                 <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">7. What Happens If Something Goes Wrong</h3>
                    <p>We treat your home like it's our own. In the unlikely event that we cause any damage, please tell us immediately. Our liability is limited to the cost of the cleaning service provided.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="mt-6 pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">

                     <p class="mb-2">We get that businesses run on invoices. Our payment terms are based on the type of work we’re doing for you:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-2">
                        <li><strong>Standard Commercial Jobs:</strong> For one-off or infrequent cleans, we operate on a 7-day account. The invoice will be sent upon job completion and is payable within 7 calendar days.</li>
                        <li><strong>Major Contracts & Ongoing Service:</strong> For clients with a formal, ongoing service agreement (like aged care facilities, hotels, or large offices), we offer 30-day account terms. Invoices are typically issued at the end of each month and are payable within 30 calendar days.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-sm">Late payments may be subject to a surcharge as outlined in your quote. All quotes must be formally accepted before work can be scheduled.</p>

                        <li><strong>No Guarantee:</strong> While we aim for the best results, we cannot guarantee 100% removal of all stains, especially those of a permanent nature (e.g., dyes, bleach, long-term chemical spills).</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-existing Conditions:</strong> We are not responsible for pre-existing conditions such as fibre wear, fading, or backing separation that may become more apparent after cleaning.</li>
